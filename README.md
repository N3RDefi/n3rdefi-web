> Welcome to N3RDefi - A Defi ecosystem for N3RDz

What is N3RDefi?
N3RDefi is a safe environment, where fellow N3RDz can come together to form a community. Being part of a community offers trust, strength, safety and commitment to a united cause, this help reduce and even eliminate bad actors.

Once bad actors have been removed from a community, it allows for better growth and yields which can help grow the eco-system. Rewards can vary from kudos for good actions, like social interactions. Rewards can also be issued in the form of NFT's which serves as weight so you can level up and gain XP in your community.

Rewards earned for being a good player can be utilised throughout the N3RDefi ecosystem, for example to purchase NFT's in our NFT marketplace, these can get staked and either put up for sale or used as a blueprint for artists, so fellow N3RDs can buy a t-shirt, hoodie or cap with their favourite 8-Bit Art. Proceeds would be distributed back to NFT holders in the form of XP, tokens or our local stableDAO.Welcome to N3RDefi - The D3fi ecosystem for N3RDs
